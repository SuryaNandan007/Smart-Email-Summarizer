Subject: Project update and next steps

Hi team,

Thanks for the update — the client has approved the revised proposal. Please send the updated timeline and delivery plan by Friday so we can begin work the following week. Also, schedule a call with the design team early next week to align on deliverables.

Action items:
- Send revised proposal before Wednesday
- Schedule call with design team

Best,
Alice
